                <p style="font-family: 'Josefin Slab', serif;text-align: left;color: #ffffff">The city is situated on the banks of the Godavari River, making it one of the holiest places for Hindus all over the world.
                    Nashik has a rich historical past,as the mythology has it that Lord Rama, the King of Ayodhya, made Nashik
                    his abode during his 14 years in exile.
                  <p>  Legend states that the name "Nashik" is derived from the Hindu epic Ramayana.
                    During the exile of Lord Ram, Shoorpanakha the sister of the demon king Raavan tried to seduce Ram.
                    Angered, Raam ordered Lakshman to cut off Shoorpanakha's nose (nashika/naak).
                    According to the Raamayan, Sita was abducted by Raavan from the area called Panchavati in the Western Ghats.
                    It is a popular religious destination within the city limits, today.</p>
                   <p> The city got its present name in 1818 when the Peshwas got control of the city.
                    The Peshwa rule however, did not last long and the British captured Nashik in the very same year.
                    In 1840, one of the first modern libraries of Maharashtra (then, the Presidency of Bombay) was founded at Nashik.
                    Just 50 years after king Ashoka death Satavahana came into prominence in Western Maharashtra. its founder was Simuka.
                    Just after Simuka ended his rule, his brother Krishna took control of the throne.
                    It was during reign of Krishna, Nashik region was included in the Satavahana Empire.
                       </p>

                <p>    Krishna left an inscription in the cave which he excavated for budhist monks near nashik.
                    Nashik also participated in the freedom struggle of India. On 21 December 1909, 17-year-old Anant Kanhere shot the Collector of Nashik,
                    Jackson in a theatre named Vijayanand theatre, where he had gone to see a play Sharada.[9] Jackson died on the spot.
                    The people involved in the incident, Anant Laxman Kanhere, Krishnaji Gopal Karve and Vinayak Ramchandra Deshpande were sentenced to death by hanging and were hanged soon after
                    There is a confusion whether it is pronounced Nasik or Nashik.</p>
                   <p> Before 1982 both the city and district were called by the name Nasik. On 7 November 1982 the population of Nasik City exceeded to 1.2 million, so as per incorporation rules,
                    Nasik City became a Corporation.
                    Since then the city name has changed to Nashik City.</p>

                        <p style="font-family: 'Josefin Slab', serif;text-align: center;color: #ffffff">Nashik, called "grape capital of India"is the leading grape producer in the country,
                            with about 1.75 lakh hectare of land under grape cultivation as of December 2015.
                            produces an estimated 10 lakh metric tonne grape at about 20 metric tonne per hectare.
                            About 8,000 acres are used for cultivation of grape wine varieties.</p>
                        <p>
                            Nashik accounts for 55 percent of total grape export from India and 75 percent from the state of Maharashtra.
                            Nashik grape export increased from about 4,000 metric tonnes in 2003 to over 48,000 metric tonnes in 2013.
                            The export further increased to more than 65,000 metric tonnes in 2014.
                            About half of the export corresponds to the Netherlands; with Germany, United Kingdom and Belgium as the next major destinations.
                            In 2013–14, Russia and China emerged as major markets for Nashik grape
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            Farmers in Nashik, India’s largest onion belt, have begun to turn their back on onion cultivation and are looking at other lucrative options.
                            Seed shortage and higher prices demanded by seed companies are also forcing them to look at other crops.
                            In the next two years, Maharashtra could face a major setback in onion cultivation.
